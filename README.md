## Features

- Allows users to input and store their personal information.
- Displays the user's information in a clean and organized card format.

## How it Works

The User Information Card is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's an overview of how it works:

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure defines the elements that make up the User Information Card:

- A `container` div that holds the card.
- Paragraph elements with distinct IDs (`first-name`, `last-name`, `country`, `phone-number`, `state`, `city`, `village`) to display the user's information.

### CSS Styling

The CSS styles define the visual appearance of the card:

- A centered and styled card with a white background, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow.
- Stylish formatting for labels and user information for a visually appealing look.

### JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code checks if user information is already stored in local storage. If not, it prompts the user to enter their information. It then stores this information in local storage and displays it on the card.
